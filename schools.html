           <p>The Bachelor of Theology degree (BTh, ThB, or BTheol) is a three- to five-year undergraduate degree in theological disciplines.<br>Candidates for this degree typically must complete course work in Greek or Hebrew, as well as systematic theology, biblical theology, ethics, homiletics, hermeneutics and Christian ministry.<br>It does not require a thesis but is often a year longer than the courses for the degrees of Bachelor of Religious Education and Bachelor of Arts. In some denominations, notably the Church of England, it is considered sufficient qualification for formal ordination.</p>
