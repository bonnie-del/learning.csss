         <h1>History of University of Eastern Africa, Baraton</h1>
      <p>
        The beginning of the Seventh-day Adventist education in this part of Africa dates back to the establishment of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the region.<br>
        The earliest church was established in Tanzania in 1903, followed by church work around Lake Victoria in Kenya in 1906.<br>
        
        In 1928 what is now known as Kamagambo Adventist College was established near Kisii town.<br>
        
        Many primary and secondary school have since been established.<br>
        
        Some of these have been offering post secondary education, but none of them has offered a full bachelor's degree program.<br>
        
        For this reason, students desiring that level of education in an Adventist institution before 1980 had to go outside Eastern Africa.<br>
        
        During the 1970s, the Middle East University in Beirut Lebanon served many such students. Thus there was a great need for a full fledged university in Eastern Africa.<br>
        
        In October 1978, the Board of the Afro-Mideast Division of Seventh-day Adventists took an action to establish such a university in Kenya on December 21, 1978.<br>The Kenya Government allotted the Baraton Animal Husbandry Research Station of 339 acres (1.37 km²) in Nandi District to the Seventh-day Adventist Church for the purpose of founding what is now known as the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton.<br>

        Classes began in January 1980 in the temporary farm structures. Some of these structures have since been replaced with new and modern buildings.<br>
